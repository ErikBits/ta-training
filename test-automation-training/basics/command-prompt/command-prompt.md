# About #
It is good to know how to do basic things with a command prompt. It makes it very easy to execute programs, traverse through your file system or perform other tasks sometimes unavailable through normal clicking. 

In windows, for normal and easy tasks I use the command prompt. This can be found when searching for it in the windows file system.

In the most basic sense, the same thing would happen if I were to make a file manually inside a directory, or when i use the command `mkdir` inside te command prompt. 

## Commands ##

### Windows native executables ###
`cd` - change directory
`dir` - get an overview of the file structure of your current working directory
`mkdir` - make a new directory


### Installed executables ###
After installing certain tools you can use the command line to clone repostitories using git, play around with a small idea in python (`py3`), run containers, quickly edit files (using Nano after installing git) and so much more. 

## Linux ## 
While it is not necessarily the scope of the course, it is good to know that other operating systems have different syntax for the command line interface (CLI). A much used operating system can be Linux/unix. One of the first things I always do when setting up a new environment for windows is installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Allowing you to run a linux environment within your windows system.

Using linux is far more dependent on using the CLI, and therefore it might be a good idea to install WSL and play around with it. When installing WSL Ubuntu, you can easily run `sudo apt install {package-name}` to install a certain dependency.
