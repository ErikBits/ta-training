/*

Playwright offers a great UI mode. You can open the Playwright UI by running `npx playwright test --ui`.

You will see a listing of all test files, and you can run specific tests directly from this ui. You can filter
through these by e.g. tags or text to find specific testcases.

After a testcase is executed, you can view a timeline at the top indicating which steps are taken and 
what the screen looked like. All the specific tests and execution times are also displayed. 

When clicking on the actions tab you can see exactly what locator was used and what action was taken. 

You can pop out the window on the right hand side to inspect the DOM for a better debugging experience.

When executing tests you can type in watch mode so you can follow along with all the steps. If you do not click 
watch mode, the test(s) will execute headless.

Try it out via the command above, or have a look at the documentation (with pictures) from the playwright website:
