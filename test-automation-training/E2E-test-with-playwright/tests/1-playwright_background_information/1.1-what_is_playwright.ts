Playwright is a tool for end-to-end testing. It supports all modern browsers, is cross playform, has API support in multiple languages
and has great features behind the scenes (more info: https://playwright.dev).

We will have a more detailed look at the features later on. For these purposes we will use the node.js version in combination with typescript.

End-to-end testing entails testing software functionality and performance of an entire software from start to finish by simulating
real-world usering scenarios. It is oriented at system integration and if everything works together seamlessly.

You automate these tests because this functionality has to be repeated often. This way you can save a lot of time and you can spot
issues quickly as an app begins to grow and you increase the amount of regression tests you have.

Playwright is made by microsoft and is an open-source project. 

Although selenium is the industry standard for browser interaction with code, playwright is a lot faster in many ways. The 
interaction with the browser is in the same process as the browser itself, whereas for selenium this is a separate process.
Communication between these processes takes more time. A quick comparison can be viewed here: https://www.zenrows.com/blog/playwright-vs-selenium#playwright

Typescript is a superset of javascript, which adds strong typing to base javascript. More information can be found here: https://www.typescriptlang.org
