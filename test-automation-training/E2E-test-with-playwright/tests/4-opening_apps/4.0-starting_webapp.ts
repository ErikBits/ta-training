/*
Now, we will actually start to work with the local app provided in the project.

Ensure it is started up by running the docker containers via `docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml\ up -d` TODO: verify if just docker-compose up will work

You can verify if it is running by accessing the page on 'localhost:3000'.

If the page shows up, you can see products on the products tab (i.e. the first entry is Drill with a stock of 1 by default), and you can log in on the 
login page with i.e. username=admin password=a, then the frontend app, backend server and mysql server are all running as expected.

For any troubleshooting please refer to the overall readme in the base of the project directory.
