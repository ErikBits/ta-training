/* 
In this file I would like to you set up your own test in its entirety.

On the bottom of the products page, admins can add products to the overview. These input fields are not visible if the user
is not an admin. I would like you to make two separate testcases, one for the admin where you add a product and verify if it
is indeed added on screen, and one for a normal user where you verify that the element is not present.

test data:
admin user: username = "admin", password = "a"
normal user: username = "John Doe", password = "password"

Good luck!
